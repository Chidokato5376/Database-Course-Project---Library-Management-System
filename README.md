# Database-Course-Project---Library-Management-System
This is the final report for the Database Project, create by group 3 from EP16A (National Economics University). Please contact me via address: tuannh2209@gmail.com if you want to know more information about this project.

In this document, we will instruct you how to operate the system, from running the database server to visualizing the data by Python code. We also establish a small web, executed by Streamlit library. Make sure that you have downloaded the SQL, Python code and set up all requirements needed for operating system.
